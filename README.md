# Jazzix

This React project was created based on a previous Capstone Project from the Microverse Program (https://github.com/abouhid/HTML-CSS-Capstone-Project).
The whole concept of it is developing the back-end code for a front-end I created 6 months before, training how to work with a legacy. 
It is supposed to simulate a Shopping website for musical instruments.
In this website you are able to: 
- Add items to your Cart;
- Add items to your Wishlist;
- Place an order;
- Fake search for instruments;
